This is my personal emacs config file.
Since I have decided to go Emacs for 2021, I'm making this a public repo.

I will focus on keeping it as simple as possible and evolve it over time as the necessities raise.
Here are some of the things I will be focusing as project evolves:

- Lightweight setup for Clojure Mode, Paredit, Linters and LSP Support
- Improve overal quality of life, ergonomics, completions, add some caveats, nothing fancy
- Provide minimal support for other languages such as Prolog, Java, C++, Go, and maybe Scala and Python
- Setup ORG Mode, LaTeX and other useful text manipulation capabilities that can be useful for Scientific Computing and personal organization

Feel free to throw suggestions, but keep in mind that this is my personal config and I'm no Emacs pro, evangelist, or something like it. I'm just giving it a try.
