I have decided to go Emacs for 2021, and this is my personal setup.
My intention is to keep it as simple as possible.

Points I wish to get working some day:

- Lightweight setup for Clojure via CIDER, Paredit Mode, Clj-kondo or Joker via Flycheck (will test both)
- Improve quality of life, ergonomics, completions (e.g. Company Mode, Flyckeck, Treemacs, maybe Projectile in the future), nothing fancy
- Provide minimalist and quality support for other languages such as C++, Python, Java, Go, and maybe Scala and Prolog as necessity surge
- Setup ORG Mode, LaTeX and other useful text manipulation capabilities that can be useful for Scientific Writing and personal organization

Keep in mind that this is my personal config and I'm no Emacs pro, evangelist, or something like it.
